Welcome. This is a simple chatbot interface that allows administrators to upload articles which then serve as the basis for guided educational conversations through specific prompts. While I'm implementing this for medical education, the framework could be adapted for various educational domains.

The project was inspired by research showing that one-on-one tutoring is significantly more effective than traditional classroom instruction - typically by one to two standard deviations. However, personalized tutoring has always been difficult to scale. Large language models, which have now achieved the ability to engage in coherent discussions across a wide range of academic subjects, present an opportunity to overcome this limitation. I believe they have the potential to fundamentally transform educational accessibility, making high-quality instruction available to everyone, anywhere, at any time, for a fraction of the traditional cost.

The code for the website is free and open source. Do with it what you may.  Enjoy.
